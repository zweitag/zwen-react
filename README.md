# zwen-react

*zwen-react* is a code generator CLI for projects using react and redux. We are
currently working on a first version which will include generation of:

* actions
* components
* constants
* helpers
* middleware
* reducers

Later versions will also include generation of barebones project architecture,
webpack setup and addition of frequently used things like forms or loaders.

The code generated by *zwen-react* follows our best practices at Zweitag and is
therefore highly opinionated.
