# zwen-react

*zwen-react* is a code generator CLI for projects using react and redux. We are
currently working on a first version which will include generation of:

* actions
* components
* constants
* helpers
* middleware
* [reducers](docs/reducers.md)
* [selectors](docs/selectors.md])

Later versions will also include generation of barebones project architecture,
webpack setup and addition of frequently used things like forms or loaders.

The code generated by *zwen-react* follows our best practices at Zweitag and is
therefore highly opinionated.

## Architecture

*zwen-react* expects your frontend architecture to follow the following structure
(names written like [this] are examples):
```
|--actions
|----[request]
|------creators.js
|------creators.test.js
|------types.js
|----creators.js
|----types.js
|
|--components

|
|--constants
|----[endpoints.js]
|
|--helpers
|----[strings.js]
|----[strings.test..js]
|
|--middleware
|----index.js
|----[sendRequest.js]
|----[sendRequest.test..js]
|
|--reducers
|----[filter]
|------index.js
|------[date.js]
