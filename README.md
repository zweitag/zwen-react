# zwen-react

*zwen-react* is a code generator CLI for projects using react and redux. You can generate the following:

* [actions](docs/action.md) :white_check_mark:
* [components](docs/component.md) :white_check_mark:
* helpers
* middleware
* [reducers](docs/reducer.md) :white_check_mark:

Later versions will also include generation of barebones project architecture, webpack setup and addition of frequently used things like forms or loaders.

The code generated by *zwen-react* follows our [best practices](docs/introduction.md) at Zweitag and is therefore highly opinionated.

## Installation
```
npm i -g zwen-react
```
or
```
yarn global add zwen-react
```

## Configuration
You can create a `.zwen` file in your project directory. Currently you only have a single option there.

```
// => .zwen
{
  "srcDir": "frontend/src" // default: "src"
}
```

## Usage
### Actions
```
zwen action path/to/actionName
```
This will create or update the action creators (`src/actions/path/to/creators.js`) and tests (`src/actions/path/to/creators.test.js`) with the `actionName`. If you choose to, it will also create or update `src/actions/path/to/types.js` with the type `ACTION_NAME`.

It will also wire up exports along the path and create new `index.js` files if they don't exist.

([More about actions](docs/action.md))

### Components
```
zwen component path/to/component
```
This will create a new component file (`src/components/path/to/Component.js`). You can choose if the component should be connected to the store, or – if not – should be set up with props.

It will also wire up exports along the path and create new `index.js` files if they don't exist.

([More about components](docs/component.md))

### Reducers
```
zwen reducer path/to/reducer
```
This will create a new reducer file `src/reducers/path/to/reducer.js` and a test file `src/reducers/path/to/reducer.test.js`.

It will also wire up exports along the path and create new `index.js` files if they don't exist.
